# 538 Visualization Project
Data wringing and visualization of dataset to recreate graph featured in 538 article, "Both Republicans And Democrats Have an Age Problem"
The purpose of this report is to replicate the graph entitled *Average Age of New Members of Congress*, which was featured in Nate Silver's article [*Both Republicans And Democrats Have an Age Problem*](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/both-republicans-and-democrats-have-an-age-problem/). The article, published in 2014, made note that the average age of congressional lawmakers was at a record height of nearly 60 years old. The dataset Silver uses draws its data from three sources: GovTrack.us, the Sunlight Foundation, and the New York Times' Congress API. It encompasses the general biographical information of Congress members from 1947 to 2013, such as party affiliation, name, birthday, and age. The data graphic that will be recreated in this report seeks to represent the major trends in the average age of Congress members by only looking at new Congress members, as incumbent members are much more likely to be older, given that they have served multiple terms. The graphic also breaks down the trend between party, showing how their mean Congressional ages have changed relative to each other.
